      body: "The Observer Pattern is a behavioral design pattern used in Low-Level Design (LLD) to establish a one-to-many relationship between objects. When a central object, called the Subject (or Observable), changes its state, all its dependents, called Observers, are notified and updated automatically.",

      body: "The pattern consists of four primary elements:",
      note: [
        "Subject/Observable (Interface/Abstract Class): Defines methods to attach, detach, and notify observers.",
        "Concrete Subject/Observable: The actual object being 'observed' (e.g., a Weather Station or Stock Market). It stores the state and triggers the notification method when that state changes.",
        "Observer (Interface/Abstract Class): Defines an update() method that the subject calls to push notifications.",
        "Concrete Observer: Objects that react to the subject's updates (e.g., a Phone Display or Email Alert system).",

        "Loose Coupling: The Subject does not need to know the concrete class of any Observer; it only interacts via the Observer interface.",
