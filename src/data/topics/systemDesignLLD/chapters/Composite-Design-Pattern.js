      body: " The Composite Design Pattern is a structural pattern used in Low-Level Design (LLD) to represent \"part‑whole\" hierarchies. It allows you to compose objects into tree structures and treat individual objects (Leaves) and compositions of objects (Composites) uniformly. Core Components: - Component: An abstract base class or interface that defines common operations for both simple and complex objects. - Leaf: A basic building block with no children that implements the Component's behavior directly. - Composite: A container that holds children (both Leaves and other Composites). It delegates work to its children and often \"sums up\" the results. - Client: Interacts with all elements through the common Component interface, unaware of whether an object is a single leaf or a large composition.",

      note: [
        "Tree Structures: When your model can be represented as a hierarchy, such as UI component trees, organizational charts, or file systems.",
        "Uniformity: When you want to eliminate complex if‑else or isinstance checks that distinguish between single items and groups.",
        "Recursive Operations: When you need to perform calculations that aggregate data from an entire structure.",
