      body: " The Command Design Pattern is a behavioral pattern that turns a request into a standalone object. In Low-Level Design (LLD), it is used to decouple the object that invokes an operation (the Invoker) from the one that knows how to perform it (the Receiver). Core Components - Command Interface: Defines the contract, usually an execute() method. - Concrete Commands: Implement the interface and bind a Receiver to a specific action.\n- Receiver: The actual object that performs the work (e.g., a Light, a Bank Account). - Invoker: Triggers the command. It holds a reference to a command but does not know its internal logic. - Client: Creates the concrete command objects and sets their receivers.",

class Command(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def execute(self):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def undo(self):
        pass

# 2. Receiver (The object doing the work)
class Light:
    def on(self):
        print("Light is ON")
    def off(self):

        "Single Responsibility Principle: You can separate classes that invoke operations from classes that perform them.",

        "Macro Support: You can combine multiple commands into a single \"macro\" command object to execute them in sequence.",
