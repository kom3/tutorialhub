      title: "Overview",
      body: "The Singleton Design Pattern is a creational pattern that ensures a class has only one instance while providing a global point of access to it. In Python, this is commonly used for managing shared resources like database connections, logging systems, or configuration managers.",

      title: "Core Implementation Methods",
      body: "There are several ways to implement the Singleton pattern in Python:",

    {
      title: "1. The \"Pythonic\" Singleton (Using __new__)",
      body: "Python's __new__ method is responsible for creating a new instance. By overriding it, you can control the instantiation to always return the same object. This approach involves checking if an instance already exists within the __new__ method and creating a new one only if it doesn't.",
      code: `class Singleton:
    _instance = None

    def __new__(cls):
        if cls._instance is None:
            # Create the instance only if it doesn't exist
            cls._instance = super().__new__(cls) # Create a new instance whose blueprint is cls.
        return cls._instance

# Usage
s1 = Singleton()
s2 = Singleton()
print(s1 is s2)  # Output: True`,

      title: "2. Thread-Safe Singleton",
      body: "To handle multi-threaded environments where multiple threads might try to create an instance concurrently, a lock can be used to ensure only one thread can proceed with the creation logic at a time.",
      code: `import threading

class ThreadSafeSingleton:
    _instance = None
    _lock = threading.Lock()

    def __new__(cls):

      title: "3. Metaclass Implementation",

    _instances = {}

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:

      title: "The \"Borg\" Pattern (Monostate)",
      body: "Distinct from the standard Singleton, the Borg pattern allows for multiple instances of a class, but they all share the same state by referencing the same internal dictionary (__dict__).",
      code: `class Borg:
    _shared_state = {}

    def __init__(self):
        # All instances share the same attributes
        self.__dict__ = self._shared_state

# Usage
b1 = Borg()
b2 = Borg()
b1.config = "Value A"
print(b2.config)  # Output: Value A
print(b1 is b2)   # Output: False (Distinct objects, shared state)`,

        "Modules as Singletons: Python modules themselves function as singletons as they are imported only once. Some developers prefer using a module-level instance rather than creating a dedicated Singleton class.",
        "Anti-Pattern Debate: Singletons are often viewed critically because they introduce global state, which can complicate unit testing and debugging due to hidden dependencies.",
        "Use Cases: Singletons are best used in scenarios where a single, unified source is truly essential, such as managing hardware device interfaces or centralized configuration data.",
