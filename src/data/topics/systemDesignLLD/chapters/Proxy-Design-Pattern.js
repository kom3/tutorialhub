      body: " The Proxy Design Pattern is a structural pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. In Low‑Level Design (LLD), a proxy acts as an intermediary that can add functionality like lazy initialization, access control, logging, or caching without modifying the original \"Real Subject\" or the client code. Core Components - Subject (Interface): An abstract class or interface defining common operations for both the real object and the proxy. - Real Subject: The actual object that performs the core business logic or resource‑heavy tasks. - Proxy: Holds a reference to the Real Subject and implements the same interface to intercept and manage client requests. Types of Proxies - Virtual Proxy: Delays the creation of expensive‑to‑instantiate objects until they are actually needed (Lazy Loading). - Protection Proxy: Controls access to the real object based on permissions or authentication. - Caching Proxy: Stores results of expensive operations to avoid redundant work for repeated requests. - Remote Proxy: Acts as a local representative for an object located in a different address space or server.",
