    {
      title: "Overview",
      body: "The Factory Design Pattern is a creational pattern used in Python to delegate the responsibility of object creation to a separate class or method. Instead of calling a class constructor directly (e.g., car = Toyota()), you ask a \"factory\" to provide the object you need (e.g., car = Factory.get_car(\"toyota\")).\n\nThis pattern is especially useful when your code needs to create various types of similar objects but should remain decoupled from their specific implementation details.",
    },
    {
      title: "Key Components",
      body: "The Factory pattern consists of the following components:",
      note: [
        "Product Interface: A common interface (usually an abstract base class in Python using abc.ABC) that defines the methods all concrete products must have.",
        "Concrete Products: The actual classes (like Car or Bike) that implement the Product interface.",
        "Creator (Factory): The component that contains the \"factory method\" to return new product instances based on input.",
      ],
    },
    {
      title: "Why Use It?",
      body: "The Factory pattern provides several important advantages:",
      note: [
        "Loose Coupling: The client code doesn't need to know the specific class names of the objects it uses, only the interface.",
        "Scalability: You can add new product types (e.g., a Bird class) by updating only the factory, rather than searching through your entire codebase for every place an object is created.",
        "Centralized Logic: All complex object creation logic (like setting default parameters or handling environment-specific configurations) is contained in one place.",
        "Open-Closed Principle: The system is open for extension (adding new products) but closed for modification (existing client code remains untouched).",
      ],
    },
    {
      title: "Real-World Scenarios",
      body: "Common real-world scenarios where the Factory pattern is useful:",
      note: [
        "Database Connections: A factory can return a MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite connection based on a configuration file.",
        "File Parsers: Creating different parsers (JSON, XML, CSV) depending on a file's extension.",
        "Payment Gateways: Switching between Stripe, PayPal, or Square depending on user selection at runtime.",
      ],
    },
    {
      title: "Types of Factory Patterns",
      body: "In software design, the \"Factory\" pattern is typically categorized into three main types based on their level of abstraction and complexity.",
    },
    {
      title: "1. Simple Factory",
      body: "This is the most basic version and is often considered a programming idiom/principle rather than a formal design pattern.",
      note: [
        "Structure: A single class with a static method that uses conditional logic (e.g., if/else or match/case) to create and return different objects based on input.",
        "Best For: Small projects where you only have one layer of related objects and the creation logic is straightforward.",
        "Analogy: A vending machine with buttons for specific products; you press a button, and it gives you exactly that item.",

        "Structure: An abstract base class defines a \"factory method,\" but subclasses override it to specify which concrete class to instantiate.",
        "Best For: When you want to adhere to the Open/Closed Principle—you can add new product types by creating new subclasses without modifying existing code.",
