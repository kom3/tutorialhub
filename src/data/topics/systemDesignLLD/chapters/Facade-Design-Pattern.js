      body: " The Facade Design Pattern is a structural pattern that provides a simplified, high-level interface to a complex subsystem. While the Adapter pattern aims for interoperability (making incompatible things work together), the Facade pattern focuses on simplicity (hiding complexity behind a single entry point). Core Components - Facade Class: The entry point that orchestrates multiple subsystem classes. - Subsystem Classes: Specialized classes that perform low-level operations. They are unaware of the Facade. - Client: Interacts only with the Facade to perform complex tasks with one call.",
