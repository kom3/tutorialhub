      body: "The Decorator Pattern is a structural design pattern used in Low-Level Design (LLD) to dynamically add new behavior or responsibilities to an object without modifying its source code. It uses composition as a flexible alternative to subclassing, effectively solving the 'class explosion' problem where creating every possible combination of features via inheritance becomes unmanageable.",

        "Component Interface: Defines the common interface for both the core objects and their wrappers.",
        "Concrete Component: The base object with original functionality (e.g., a 'Plain Coffee').",
        "Base Decorator: An abstract class that implements the component interface and contains a reference to a component object.",
        "Concrete Decorators: Specific wrappers that extend the base decorator to add specific behaviors (e.g., 'Milk' or 'Sugar').",

      code: `from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# 1. Component Interface
class Coffee(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def get_description(self) -> str:
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def get_cost(self) -> float:
        pass

# 2. Concrete Component
class PlainCoffee(Coffee):
    def get_description(self):
        return "Plain Coffee"
    
    def get_cost(self):
        return 2.0

# 3. Base Decorator (Abstract)

    def __init__(self, coffee: Coffee):
        self._coffee = coffee

    def get_description(self):
        return self._coffee.get_description()

    def get_cost(self):
        return self._coffee.get_cost()

# 4. Concrete Decorators

      note: [
        "Adheres to Open/Closed Principle: New functionality can be added by creating new decorator classes without touching existing ones.",
        "Solves Class Explosion: Avoids creating dozens of subclasses for every permutation of features (e.g., CoffeeWithMilk, CoffeeWithSugar, CoffeeWithMilkAndSugar).",
        "Runtime Flexibility: Allows features to be added or removed at runtime based on user input or state.",
        "Layered Responsibility: Each decorator handles one specific task, following the Single Responsibility Principle.",
