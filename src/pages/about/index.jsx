      <h1>About the Author</h1>
      <p>
        Hi, I’m Manjunath. I am a Full Stack Developer with a deep passion for
        building scalable systems and continuously learning new technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years, I’ve worked across the full stack — from crafting
        intuitive front-end experiences in React, to building robust backend
        systems using Node.js, FastAPI, and Django. I’ve designed and optimized
        databases using PostgreSQL and MongoDB, and I actively explore modern
        architectures, system design principles, and emerging technologies like
        Agentic AI development.
      </p>

      <h2>Why I Created This Platform</h2>
      <p>
        As a developer, I constantly explore new tools, frameworks, and
        architectural patterns. While learning, I maintain structured notes of
        key insights, patterns, and important concepts — the kind of notes I
        wish I had during interviews or while building production systems.
      </p>
      <p>This platform serves two purposes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A knowledge base for myself — a place to revisit critical concepts
          when needed
        </li>
        <li>A beginner-friendly and interview-ready resource for others</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </main>
